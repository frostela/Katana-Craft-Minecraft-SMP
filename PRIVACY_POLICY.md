## 1. Data We Collect

The bot only collects the minimum information required to function:

| Data collected | Why it is used | Stored? |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Discord User ID | Required for message relay identification | ❌ Not permanently stored |
| Username / Nickname | To show who sent the message in MC chat | ❌ Not permanently stored |
| Message Content (text only) | To sync chat between Discord ↔ Minecraft SMP | ✅ Temporarily, only in RAM/logs via DiscordSRV/Minecraft server logs |

The bot **does NOT**:
- collect or store passwords
- collect personal information
- sell or share any data

---

## 2. Where Data Goes

Messages from the Discord channel are relayed to:
- The Minecraft SMP in-game chat
- Server console logs (standard Minecraft logging)
- Discord logs (standard Discord logging)

None of the message data is manually stored by the bot in any database.

---

## 3. Data Deletion

This bot does **not store any data** on its own.

All messages relayed through the bot are only visible temporarily in:
- Discord message history (handled by Discord)
- Minecraft server logs (automatically generated by the server software)

Because the bot itself does not maintain its own database and does not save data independently, **data deletion requests cannot be fulfilled by the bot owner**, as the data is not stored by the bot.

Users may delete their own messages on Discord (subject to permission),
but Minecraft server logs and console logs **cannot be selectively removed**.


---

## 4. Third Party Services

This bot indirectly interacts with:
- **Discord** (discord.com/terms)
- **Minecraft Server Software (Paper / Spigot / Pterodactyl)**

Their policies apply separately.

---

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Updates will be posted here.  
Continued use of the SMP Discord channel implies acceptance.

If you have questions contact the owner.
